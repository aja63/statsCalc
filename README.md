Abraham Allen did the random and sampling modules.







For this project, you need to create a statistical calculator with tests that can perform the functions listed below. You also need to create a library to use when creating your tests that can generate random data and make random selections. The random data needs to use a seed to ensure that you generate the same random data each time you run your tests, so that your calculations will remain the same. 
Random Generator function

1.Generate a random number without a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
2. Generate a random number with a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
3. Generate a list of N random numbers with a seed and between a range of numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
4. Select a random item from a list
5. Set a seed and randomly.select the same value from a list
6. Select N number of items from a list without a seed
7. Select N number of items from a list with a seed

Population Sampling functions
1. Simple random sampling 
2. Systematic sampling
3. Confidence Interval For a Sample
4. Margin of Error
5. How to Find a Confidence Interval
6. Cochran’s Sample Size Formula
7. How to Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width (unknown population standard deviation)
8. How to Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width (known population standard deviation)



Descriptive Statistics functions
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Variance
5. Standard Deviation
6. Quartiles
7. Skewness
8. Sample Correlation
9. Population Correlation
10. Z-Score
11. Mean Deviation / Mean Absolute Deviation

How to plan the project:
1. You need to plan the development of the project based on the dependencies that each formula has.
a. For example: Standard Deviation requires that you calculate a mean and a variance, so you will need these functions developed first.
2. Program Skeleton 
a.  Random Generator Class
i. Random methods in their own classes
b.  Basic Calculator Object Class
i.  MathOperations Class with Static Methods for each operation
1.  Addition
2.  Subtraction
3.  Etc… Each operation should be in its own class
c.  Stats Calc Object Class
i. Population Operations Static Class
1.  Population Methods in their own classes
ii.  Description Stats Class
1.Description Methods in their own classes
